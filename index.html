            Hi, I'm Shabbir, a seventh-grade student who likes web development. I know HTML, CSS, Flexbox, CSS Grid(used in this website), PHP,  Vanilla JS, JS Canvas, Matter JS, and Three JS(which I used to make this website)

            As you probably read above, I'm Shabbir Nampurwala, a twelve-year-old 7th grader, who also likes coding(web development). I'm not very good at it, but I'm trying to learn and get better.

           <h3 id="whoAmI" class="secondaryTitle">Who Am I?</h3>

           <p id="whoAmI" class="para">
            I am a student studying in the Bishops Co-Ed School Undri, Pune. I study in Class 7. I was born on February 21 2012. I also am an aspring web developer, but I am not very good at coding and I am still trying to learn. 
           </p>

           <h3 id="HowDidIGetHere" class="secondaryTitle">How Did I Get Here</h3>

           <p>I learnt the basics of HTML from school, then I learnt some basic CSS from watching someone make a webpage on YouTube. But this was a waste of time(maybe not the school part) because I learn all the basics and more from Zach Gollwitzer's amazing bootcamp course where he teaches all about HTML, CSS, vanilla JS, Flexbox and even CSS Grid. Find the course <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys">here</a>. Then I spent a lot of time(more than required) doing Frontend Mentor projects I already knew how to do.Then, I wanted to learn backend programming, so I learnt PHP and used it to make a chatting app know as ChatApp(find it in my portfolio). Then, I ran out of frontend mentor projects, so I found another project online, which involved canvas. So I learnt JS Canvas, and used it to make a breakout game(called BreakoutGame[very intellectual name, I know]) which you can find in my portfolio. Then I realized that on some screens, breakoutGame would become an infinite loop leaving some bricks untouched and impossible to touch. So I decided I wanted to make it using actual physics so this wouldn't happen. I learnt Matter JS and used it to make BreakoutGame 2.0 where this wouldnt happen. I then saw a Three JS tutorial recommended to me on YouTube and decided to learn it and used it to make this website.</p>
